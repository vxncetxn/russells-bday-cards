Happy birthday Russell! So glad to have met you in the CG and a big THANK YOU for fixing my keyboard 🙏 always so good to reminisce about school days with a fake batchie haha here’s to more hangouts with fairy lights and dry ice… hope to talk to you more! Have a great sem and looking forward to celebrating your next milestone together as a CG! Have a blessed birthday!

And here’s one good pun:

Why is it best to teach physics at the edge of a cliff?

Because that’s where students have the most potential.
