Hi Russell, happy birthday!! It's been so much fun hanging around ya! Still remember our influencer-wannabe moment in JB where gosh...it's truly not easy being one. Really appreciate your heart for the CG too, through the way you organised and hosted us during countdown - it definitely made ending 2023 so much more memorable! Am excited to see the great things you'll accomplish this year aaand cya real soon!

Love,
Dex
