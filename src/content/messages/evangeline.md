HPBD Russell!

Been nice having you around for the past couple of weeks. Donâ€™t get to talk to you often but it was fun night cycling with you the other day. Also, was very warmed by your hospitality on NYE when you opened up your house for us! I also loved when you candidly shared about your struggles and triumphs that day too. Have a fruitful and safe final sem(?) of uni ðŸ¥³ Looking forward to your return to sg!

Physics joke of choice:
Einstein developed a theory about space.
It was about time too.
