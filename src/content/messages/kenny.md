Happy borndate Russ!! Grr i'm writing this the night before my internship so hopefully i don't regret staying up for this. I think one of my more memorable moments this past year is when we went to buy cai fan and we had conversations about academia, and that how it could potentially be a path for me! I feel that thats a turning point in our friendship haha where we can talk about really nerdy stuff but still laugh at everything! Thanks for being a constant in this CG, and glad to hear that you love SD4 cause same (except siva sometimes). Enjoy this card overseas and I'll be praying for your masters applications!! Have a great one!
