Happy birthday Russell 🥳 really glad that I got to know you better before you fly off again . I rmb I was really scared of you at the first. Back then whenever I sat next to you, I would be praying for pastor to not say “tell the person sitting next to your left and right …..” but don’t worry I am not scared of you anymore hahahahah. I don’t think I will ever understand your physics jokes but I will try my best to laugh at it😊 also really admired how you always stand firm on what you believe in and staying true to yourself 👍🏻 we will miss while you’re gone 😢
