happy birthday russell!! it’s been 5 whole years since we have known each other and you’re still as unhinged as ever LOL

some things never change, but that’s also the fun and joy of friendship!!! glad to find a friend in you :) from the shopee jokes, all the random white gworl moments, the conversations you attempt to strike up even when you’re awkward w small talk, to the times that we get to grow in God tgt w the CG, i have seen how you’re growing to be more relational in different areas :)

keep being yourself and stepping out of your comfort zone!! you’re a great friend to many and here’s to many more years in God tgr!
