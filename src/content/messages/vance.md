Happy 24th birthday Russell! I know that we do not get to talk much with each other but I am still so glad to know such a brilliant mind like you in the CG! Haha when I was shown your academic website for the first time, I remember thinking to myself how I probably understood less than a third of what was written over there (the only time-crystal I know is from Marvel's Loki show hahaha)! You told me briefly that you had plans to further your studies after you finish your undergraduate education, and I pray that throughout this arduous but rewarding journey that your loved ones and God will be with you at every step of the way. Have a memorable birthday and a safe trip back to the UK!
