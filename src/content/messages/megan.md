i love catching up with you everytime you come back. I know sometimes its just more of an existing together and you may not know what to say but each time I'm glad we get to hear how everything has been, how your love life as been evolving and how you are thinking about growing closer to God and your destiny. perhaps you feel quite far not just physically but spiritually and emotionally as well. sometimes we go through times where we got to stretch and hold onto promises God has spoken! as you go through such times, remember how much God has in store for you. And rmb your dream to be a board member, to make an impact with your gifts and all the prayers SPs have prayed over you during revival nights... they are very much alive and kicking and one day everything is going to come to pass :) even tho it was years ago, i love the times at the frontlines in testimony with you and also just spending endless times laughing over sheldon. You always have a place in Pastors and all our hearts! we love you and happy birthday!!
