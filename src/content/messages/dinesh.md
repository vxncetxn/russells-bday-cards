Britain colonised the world; like a colon, whatever they took in, they turned to shit.

Russell! Happy birthday!

Love dissing them Brits with ya! Truly, the common experience of that country has provided fodder for much banter. I’m glad that beyond the banter, we’ve conversed about the things that are significant too. Speaking of significant things, the next phase of life awaits you! There’s so much potential ahead of you and I believe God is going to release you into bigger places accompanied by greater measures of ease and favour. Seeing how you walk with confidence in your niche gifting and calling inspires and encourages me that being different isn’t a bad thing. Keep chasing God, and the greater thing God has prepared for you in the new season to come!
