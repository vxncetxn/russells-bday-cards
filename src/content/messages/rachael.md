Good afternoon, my name is Russell, and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12. Are you in need of any assistance today, sir?

Hi Russell! Happy birthday! Though i have not known you for very long and we had maybe a grand total of half a conversation, it’s always fun seeing you interact with others and share your opinions unapologetically. At the start of BF season, i recall you sharing passionately about tithing and how the church was built on the sacrifices of many others before us. That really showed me the depth of your care and love for the church. You inspire me to stay true to myself while rooted in faith. Hope to have more opportunities to get to know you better and hear your opinions on many interesting topics.

Have the best birthday~ we will miss you while you’re gone! 生日快乐 see you again very soon ~
