Happy birthday, Russell! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‚
It's been fun getting to see you around more when you're in SG!
I can see that while you're busy maneuvering like a Hamiltonian through many places in life,
you always put aside time to come Fellowship with us and begin to slowly unravel new dimensions
of our CG aside from just quantum mechanics or NUS Wi-Fi network haha! Thanks so much for
inviting us over to celebrate New Years together. God's working really strongly in you and as
the 4th or 5th Generation of HOGC, I have no doubt that future generations will be empowered
by people like you! Have an amazing Birthday!ðŸŽ‰
