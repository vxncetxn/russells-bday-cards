happy birthday russell!!! :)) used to be really intimidated by you in my jc days.. but it’s funny how we always end up in the same cg again and again hahahaha i think it was like fate or something for me to get to know you properly HAHAHA now we grow old together… i really respect that though you’re in and out of sg, your heart is never far from God and His house.. and whenever you’re back, it always feels like you never left. and i’ve seen how you’ve opened up bit by bit over the years to the ppl around you!!! i know you’ve a lot of substance in you,, so can’t wait to hear more from you :) thankyou for being a gr8 friend to siva too!!! hope you have a happy celebration in sg before you leave and find something memorable to do on the day of your bday as well!
love, sriharini
