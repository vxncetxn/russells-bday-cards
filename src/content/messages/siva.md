Dear Russell, Happy Birthday buddy! I am soo glad over the years I have known you, we have became better friends.. I remember the time when I was insecure to even speak amongst you, but you were the first few to reach out and truly express that you liked having me around the CG! I have learnt soo many things from you, but the biggest thing I took away from our friendship was humility. I am inspired by not only your intellect, but your character as well Russ!

Love the questionable conversations we have, that I’m sure if anyone else heard – especially our partners – will result in us getting our heads knocked together. LOL! Have nothing but love for you Russ! Praying for your breakthroughs and all that you have dreamt about this year. Have a blessed year ahead Russ.. See you soon 

With Love ~ Siva
