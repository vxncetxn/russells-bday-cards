HEY RUSSEL!

Happy Birthday!! Congratulations on riding the earth another round around the sun.

Thank you for being unafraid of silence, for always caring for the CG and for your hilariously honest and direct personality. No matter the occasion your witty comments never fail to get a laugh out of me.

Hope you have another amazing solar cycle!

CS TGT SOON!
